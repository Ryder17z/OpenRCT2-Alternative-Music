# OpenRCT2 Alternative Music

I have tried to tie each example roughly to a certain theme, but I'm not an expert on musical genres.

Names within parenthesis is a suggestion for a vanilla style override. E.g. "Ice" could potentially be replaced by "Antartica style" from this repository.

None of the ingame names or cuts/edits are final, suggestions on how to improve these music files are welcome.

In each folder, there will be at least the source file and the output file, .parkobj file and the object.json
Some folders will have an intermediate FLAC file.

All of the songs above are covered by CC-BY so there shouldn't be any licensing issues, including remixing and slicing/splicing songs if someone wants to do that.
